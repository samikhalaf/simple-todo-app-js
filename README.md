# Simple ToDo app in Vanilla JS (ES6)

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Sami Khalaf, and I've developed this app with plain HTML + CSS + Javascript ES6.

This is mainly an exercise for me to polish my skills as a front-end developer, so I hope you check this out and enjoy it as much as I did programming it.

## ✨ Key features

This is a simple task list. The fun thing is that saves all data in users browser's local storage, so once is deployed you can actually use it for traking your own ToDo's!

1. Write down some tasks.
2. You can either mark them as done, or delete them from the list.

Maybe I'll add some cool features in the future, such as:

- Light/Dark mode
- Drag and drop ToDo's for rearranging the order
- Dynamic columns

## Regarding developement

- Plain JavaScript (ES6) programming, no frameworks and no crazy libraries 💪🏿.
- Web Responsive design, with CSS variables and cool stuff.
- Usage of BEM methodology for organising styles.
- All your tasks are stored in your localStorage's browser. Only you have access about the things you write down.
- No cookies and no surveillance 👌🏿

Enjoy!
